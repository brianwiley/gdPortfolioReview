            <h1>2019 Graphic Design Portfolio Review</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In order to take 300 and 400 level courses in the Boise State Graphic Design Program, students must first meet all prerequisite course requirements as well as pass a portfolio review. This portfolio review occurs at the end of the Spring semester and preparation is incorporated into ART 288 Graphic Design Studio II. Transfer students, regardless of standing at their previous institution, must first pass the portfolio review as well.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the review is to ensure that students have all the requisite skills and knowledge base to successfully complete all upper-division coursework. The assessment is made by faculty members of the Graphic Design Program, and is based primarily upon the creative work presented, as well as writing samples and contextual statements.</p>
            <p>The portfolio—and the projects presented within—are assessed independently of course grades. Do not assume that having received a good grade in class ensures a successful portfolio; likewise, do not assume that a mediocre grade ensures an unsuccessful portfolio. While there is often a correlation, course grades are determined by many factors (attendance, participation, tests, etc.) independent of the creative work presented and have no bearing on the work assembled for your portfolio.</p>
            <p>Your portfolio will be assessed by the faculty members and assigned a score of Pass or No-Pass. Students who receive a pass may register for upper-division course work in Graphic Design. Students who received a No-Pass lack the proficiencies necessary for successful completion in the Graphic Design Program and will not be admitted into upper-division coursework. Students receiving a No-Pass may apply in following years, and may wish to retake ART 277 and ART 288 to strengthen their portfolio, but are not required to do so.</p>
            <p>All students will be notified via letter of the status of their portfolio in mid-summer. It is critical that your portfolio have your most up-to-date address of where you will be located at that time so that you can be successfully notified of that decision.</p>
            <h2>Portfolio Contents</h2>
            <p>The portfolio for the review should include studio work (listed below) from Art 277 and Art 288 from the current academic year. Transfer student work, and work from previous academic years, should be identified and included at the applicants discretion.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the portfolio should include 1–2 projects from outside the graphic design curriculum. These can be work from other classes such as ART 251, self-initiated projects, or perhaps client work.</p>
            <p>Please include a one paragraph outline (100–150 words) for all outside or transfer-credit projects that describe the scope and context of the work.</p>

Transfer students who wish to enroll in upper-division Graphic Design studio courses must also submit examples of their equivalent studio coursework and pass the Review. Transfer students are responsible to notify Graphic Design faculty in advance during the first three weeks of the Review semester.</p>
